# FastApi-FullConcept
 
The diagram illustrates the workflow of a FastAPI application, focusing on request handling, data validation, and token-based authentication. A user interacts with a web browser to submit requests, such as navigating the application or submitting a form with JSON data. These requests are sent to the FastAPI server, which validates the input using Pydantic models. If the input is valid, the server interacts with a database to store or retrieve data, and returns a success response to the user. If the data is invalid, an error message is returned.

For protected resources, FastAPI checks for a valid JWT token. If the token is valid, the server retrieves the protected data from the database. If the token is invalid or missing, access is denied. This sequence showcases FastAPI's efficient handling of requests, data validation, and authentication processes, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.
